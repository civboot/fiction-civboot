Open source Civboot related fiction. Feel free to contribute your own under the
license terms (see below).

The "universe" this fiction takes place in is described in `toll/start1.md`.
Human life has been nearly extinguished in an Armagedon, with only five (or so)
Civboots remaining, along with the one on Mars.

The Civboot ("Civboot A") that Toll is in has 5 people. Once some of their
characters get introduced, feel free to contribute your own stories from the
other characeter's vantage points. Or start writing for another Civboot in the
same universe. Stories here are intended to be kept episodic and short, small
pieces of particular problems or dramas which can be woven into a whole. In
general, one characer should be written from only a single author unless
authors agree to collaborate. Timelines are less important, as long as a rough
year (for the beginning) or decade are deliniated in the story's header which
should be of this form:

```
Author: Garrett Berg (github.com/vitiral)
Perspective: Toll Bansha
Other characters: Maye Johnson
Time period: 3 months after The Event.
Primary Location: Civboot A, main living areas.
```

Where is Civboot A? What is the back-story of Maye? These things have not yet
been covered by the story. They will grow organicaly just like the story does.
However, as they are grown they should be made to be consistent across the
other episodes.
