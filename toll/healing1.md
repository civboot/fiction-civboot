I awake with a groan. Immediately the headache hits me, hammering into my
skull and forcing me to lay back down. I glance around me, seeing the TV
of only blank digital static. I close my eyes, wishing to go back to sleep.
"Please, give me back the nightmare I was having" I speak into the empty bunk.
There is no response, not even an echo.

I lay in bed for another... how long? Twenty minutes? Did I doze? I didn't
remember.  When I do wake again the headache is a little less and the clock next
to the TV says 11:15 AM. Wearily I sit up cross legged in the confined space of
the bunk. I tap on the TV screen and it turns off.  I don't know why I keep
turning it on. Some kind of uncontrollable impulse.  Two large empty bottles lay
at the end of my bed labeled "Celebration Wine".  I had stared at the blank TV
last night, draining both bottles. I had never been much of a drinker, but there
wasn't any choice now. The only problem was, we were almost out of wine.

I rub sweat off my forehead in the chill air. My headache is now less, but it is
still brutal. I take out three aspirin from a drawer and swallow them with the
last remaining dregs of wine. Wearily I open the hatch of my bunk and exit my
bunk, grabbing Jamie's bunk... no, what _had_ been Jamie's bunk. He was dead now
wasn't he. I let out a small sob, triggering my stomach to turn and the aspirin
I had just taken to come out onto the floor. It's going to be another shitty
day.

After my stomach feels like it's done vomiting, I mechanically move to
the bathroom to wash out my mouth and pee. It stings as it trickles out. "Must
drink more water" I say to nobody, but the thought of it turns my stomach
again and I nearly vomit. Instead of water I take an anti-nausea pill from the
medicine cabinet and hold it under my tongue. As the nausea passes I think
again of the surface. Of all the people now dead. I start to wish for the
nausea, or anything else, that could help me forget.

Nearly three months I've been like this, going off and on between drinking
heavily and doing anything I could to numb myself. I'm not sure how long I can
stay alive. Stay alive in this state of perpetual despair. Jamie had killed
himself on the second day. The knowledge that his family had been incinerated in
one of the first rounds of H Bombs had put him into a kind of stasis. I hadn't
even seen the man cry. There was just two days of shock followed by a rope
around his neck and his body hanging from a pipe.

We had held a kind of funeral, the five of us who were left. It had felt
like a funeral for all civilization, although at that time we hadn't known
how much worse it could get. The funeral had been pretty pathetic, mostly
silent sobs with a few words to Jamie's credit. Then we put his body in the
industrial composter. There wasn't anywhere else to put him. We thought of maybe
joining him, letting their particles dissolve back into the microbial and
Mycenaean matter we all came out of. But nobody did. We just walked away and
dealt with the immense loss of a colleague and out entire civilization in
out own way. Some cried in each other's arms, spiritually naked and empty. Some
drank until they were numb. No humans in history had grieved like this, grieved
for their entire species. There really was nothing else that could be done.

From what could be gathered from the TV and rare reports from NASA headquarters,
an H Bomb had somehow been detonated in North Korea. Nobody knew who detonated
it, although it was postulated that North Korea had accidentally detonated one
of their own. Regardless, what happened next was far, far worse. Some software
routine noticed the detonation and starting sending out nukes of it's own from
China. This software was supposed to have been verified and tested to not do
this for a single detonation under any circumstances, since the designers _knew_
the possibility of accidental detonation. They also knew the consequences of
sending nukes over half the world: mutually assured destruction. More H Bombs
coming out of China triggered other software to behave exactly as intended
sending nucs back their direction. China's software, noticing the incoming Nucs
returned the favor to the rest of the world.

This was when Jamie had committed suicide. He had been lucky to do it so early,
because what happened next was more horrifying than the initial destruction.
A bomb must have damaged one of the bio engineering facilities only discussed in
horror novels. It released some kind of disease, possibly the worst disease
humanity could possibly conceive. Why whoever had not only conceived it but
actually built it was not made clear in the panicked television broadcasts, but
what was clear were these facts: (1) the disease was basically the AIDS virus.
(2) the disease had no symptoms for more than a month. (3) the disease was
insanely contagious via the air. Simply being within several feet of a person
was enough to become infected. (4) nobody was immune to the virus.

Just like AIDS the virus did not kill you directly, it simply shut down your
immune system until you eventually succumbed any bacteria or virus that came
along, even the bacteria that had been happily growing on your own skin. Nobody
had even known there _was_ a virus until several weeks in, and with people
flocking to every corner of the earth trying to find food and escape the mass
panic, the virus spread to basically every human being on Earth. That is, every
human except those living in bunkers designed to replicate the environments
of those living on Mars. Which is exactly where I and my previously five,
now four, colleagues find ourselves.

So everyone started dying and eventually all contact with the surface was lost.
The final reports had been images of empty cities, what few hadn't been
flattened. Oil wells spewing crude into the oceans. Fires across the earth with
a blackened sky. Destruction. Death. Despair. Destruction. Death. Despair.

"Destruction. Death. Despair. Destruction. Death. Despair."

I slap myself in the face to not repeat the words again. Mayn glances up at me
from the sound and I notice for the first time there aren't tears or dark
circles under her eyes. She wraps me in a big hug, holding me tightly, her face
nestled in my chest. Her hands massage up and down my back. The touch and
pressure start to release some of my tension, a gentle sigh escapes my mouth. I
feel some of my stress and pain lessening. "A bit better?" she asks. Her eyes
looked sharp again, her muscles more relaxed.

"Yes" I respond. Over the past several months there had been bursts of physical
contact broken by long stretches of forced solitude. Norms around touch that had
been built up over a lifetime had suddenly collapsed in the well of sadness we
now found ourselves. Nearly animal instincts had replaced the carefully
practiced social dance. We were like animals trying to find shelter from a
hurricane of despair. Memories of our intimate contact surface. It had been
instinctual, like nothing I'd every experienced.

I take Maye in my arms again, my muscles tensing to hug her tightly. It feels
good to be here. It feels good to have someone to hug. It feels good to be
alive. It feels good to have medicated relief from the headache and nausea.

After a long time we release each other and go to the kitchen to make breakfast.
Maye starts boiling some water and takes a liter of dry oatmeal from the
cabinet and sets it on the counter.

She bits her lip, as if to try and stop the words but then says "I know I've
said this before, but I think we have to let go of... let go of the surface.
There isn't anything that we can do any more. We have to keep... have to
start..."

She trails off. She has said it before, we have to start moving again. Start
living again. We are the only ones that were left... well us and the other
five Civboots scattered around the earth... then the fity or so people on
Mars... maybe some people in bunkers, or far out in the country? Maybe even some
had been immune to the disease? But not many. Certainly not many. We were all
that was left.

Trains of thought like this had only made me even sader before. They had
reminded me of what was lost. What would never be returned. I didn't have kids,
but I had known many people on the surface. There were deep connections that
were now severed.  With my parents and brother. With my best friends. With my
ex-girlfriends, one of which I had continued a friendship. Another I had
continued to hold onto a crush despite knowing it would never happen.

This time was different, something lifted. I only nodded and noticed surprise on
Maye's face. Honestly I was surprised myself. I could feel a large part of my
tension lifting. There wasn't a reason that this time was different. Maybe
after months of despair I was finally starting to heal. I've heard that humans
are more resilient than people think and can heal from practically any tragedy
within as little as three months.

We sat down next to each other with our oatmeal, it's warmth feeling good in
my stomach. "So as I was saying," continues Maye "we need to start living again.
Start _doing_ something... I'm just not sure what we should do. We can't go
to...  go to the surface. At least not yet! But we shouldn't just stay down here
and mope either."

I finish chewing my oatmeal. "It sounds reasonable, I just don't know what we
can do. Over the past two weeks the biggest concern I've had is that we are
going to run out of wine."

"It's not just wine! This facility is not completely automated you know. Some
of the vertical farms and manufacturing is automated, but it is our job to
actually move the food to refrigeration and prepare it in meals. There are
other things too" she say vaguely, waving a hand "like doing maintenance checks,
changing the air filters, transferring the compost..." she trailed off, the
thought of Jaime's body sitting in said compost stopping her short. In not
terribly long Jaime's corpse would be incorporated into their food. The circle
of life.

"Anyway" she continues, "we should start doing some work if for no other reason
than work is good for us. Having something to do will help us all feel better."

"I'm still wondering whether I even want to feel better" I say "or whether
I just want to follow Jaime's lead."

"Don't do that!" she hisses in anger. "Don't do that... we need you. I need
you." she stars crying, her tear free cheeks flooding freely "I've already
lost the world, I can't loose any more. I can't loose another friend. Not now.
Please don't say that."

"I won't do it" I say, putting my arm around her and holding her body close to
mine "but I can't say I don't think about it. It's one of the few coherent
thoughts I have, one of the few things that reminds me I'm still here." She puts
her face into my shoulder, her sobs starting to lessen.

My hand moves up, stroking the hair on her forehead away. "Don't worry about
me, I'm not going anywhere. I think you're right, we need to start doing
something. But let's leave it at that for the day? I feel tired again and want
to lie down." I push my oatmeal away, only half eaten. The kitchen is a mess,
full of half eaten food on unclean dishes.

She's right of course, they would at least have to start cleaning properly.
Cooking real food again, taking care of the farm. And then there was the problem
that they were living in a Tin can 1,000 meters below the surface of the earth.
And not just any Tin can, a _prototype_ Tin can with "improvements" meant for
Mars. Improvements they were supposed to be testing on the relative safety of
Earth. Oh, they would have problems -- that was true enough. It had been their
jobs to iron out any kinks in the hardware, software and mechanisms so that it
could be sent to Mars. Now it wasn't just a job, it was what their lives
depended on.
