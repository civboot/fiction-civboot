When I come into the mess hall, Dr Jong is already there sitting by herself;
staring at a picture. She looks different than before the event. I had always
thought her face was particularly wrinkle free for someone in their lower
sixties, but in the last three months her face seemed to have aged ten years.
Distinct wrinkles are forming around the eyes of a face that had, until now,
rarely formed an expression.

Then the real difference strikes me. Her face, wrinkled as it was, was again
more or less expressionless. Over the last months her expression had been like
the surface of a deep well of pain. It had been an expression I had avoided,
like I had avoided my own pain. I sat across from her with my oatmeal, silently
eating. I'm here... but I'm not sure how to begin a conversation. Everything has
changed and the simple act of talking seems unfamiliar.

She broke the silence. "A picture of my family" she says, sliding the picture to
me. "I've been staring at it almost continuously for the last three months. It
seems my tears have run out."

I hold the picture. It is a three generation photo with at least sixteen people
in it, many of them little kids. "Your kids and grandchildren?"

She nods. "Dead now of course. In heaven with almost everyone else." Then,
taking a deep breath "It's time I accept that. Time I move on."

A kind of silence hangs in the air. Yup, I still don't know how to talk to
people.  Truth is I had never been good at discussing religion without being
offensive, and I find it particularly hard to understand how anyone an believe
in a biblical God now that Revelation has literally passed. The apocalypse has
come and gone, four horsemen and all. There was no City on a Hill. No Jesus
Christ descended from heaven. Just death, destruction and despair.

"You and Maye seem to be doing better" she says, cutting the awkwardness.

I take a sharp intake of breath, snapping out of my chain of thought. "Yes.
Better." I say, "Maye too. Like you said, its like the tears have dried out. I
feel...  mostly numb. Or at least like the part of my body that feels sadness
is numb. I'm able to taste food again, find some things funny... even if my
humor is a bit fucked up."

Dr Jong cuckles "A fucked up humor is healthy in a time like this. So too is
numbness. Few in history have ever experienced anything comparable. Maybe Noah
at the flood of the world? Yet despite the earth itself crying for 40 days and
nights, there was little mention of Noah's sadness. How are we supposed to feel?
Supposed to cope?" Her face takes on an expression of almost anger "Fuck how we
are supposed to cope. Just let the feelings be what they are. All things come
and go. This too shall pass." It was said almost stoical, yet there is some
sadness. The well can never go completely dry.

"As a former Medical Commander in the Navy I thought myself pretty resilient"
she continues. "But nobody except a true sociopath could be resilient to what
has happened. As a doctor I try to remind myself the need to heal, that
sometimes healing can be more painful than the injury itself. Sometimes you
never recover. Or recovery means permanent change. We will never be the same
again. But we must try to continue, in whatever way we can."

More silence, this time less uncomfortable. We just sit, eating oatmeal for
several minutes. "So, what should we do?" I ask. She seems like the right
person to ask. She is supposed to be the leader after all.

"I've been thinking about that as well. Ah, speaking of Maye.." Maye entered the
mess hall looking tired, but still better than she had in months. She got some
oatmeal from the pot.

"You look better Dr Jong" Maye says, sitting next to me but leaving a
professional amount of space.

"Please, everyone should call me just Tay" says Dr Jong, "unless they need a
doctor that is. Then calling me Dr will get my attention. There are very few
people left alive, there is no need for hierarchies any longer."

"Tay then" says Maye, "but I disagree with you. I very much want someone to be
in charge and I feel that person should be you. I'm tired of wallowing in this
state of doing nothing. Toll and I have cleaned up some of our mess over the
last several months; what's next? I signed up for being down here for three
months. Will I now be underground for the rest of my life? What's going to
happen?"

Another silence falls. Tay and I had finished our oatmeal and we're now just
slowly sipping our coffee. It was a tough question that nobody had the answer
to.

"Yes, you are probably right that we need a leader" says Tay. "I'm hurting just
like everyone else so I wish that didn't have to be me, but I've probably got
to be the one to bite the bullet and do it. First of all I don't think we should
push Carlos and Beth. Please give them whatever support comes naturally to you,
but let them heal in their own way. For now it will just be the three of us;
we'll do the best we can. Remind me again each of your specialties."

"I'm a computer science PhD" I say. "I'm not an expert in Civboot but I took
the programming training before coming down here. I've been pretty successful
in hacking their software... which means modifying it towards whatever ends I
want."

"Okay," says Tay "and how about you Maye?"

"I"m a bio-engineer in vertical farming, breeding, genetics and optimized food
production. I've also done some work with recycling difficult to process
industrial waste into compostable or manufacturable materials."

"Maye is leaving out that she's a fucking genius." I cut in. "She invented a
process whereby fungi consumes plastic waste and byproducts to become compost
for food. We literally couldn't have most of our plastics down here if it
weren't for her, since we wouldn't be able to truly recycle them."

Maye blushes slightly but doesn't disagree. "Good" says Tay. "We're definitely
going to need to eat food and work with software, so I'm glad you have the
skills you do it. My skills are mostly that I'm a medical doctor and know how to
be in charge. Hopefully we won't need to put my doctoring skills to work any
time soon. What are your thoughts on first steps?"

Maye responds first. "I think we should try and store some extra food.  Our
rations have been cut into significantly over the last several months, with
nobody harvesting. Fortunately the automated processes have been simply
re-composting it so nothing has broken, but we need to build up a good store for
when something goes wrong."

"What are the chances of that?" asks Tay.

"The chances aren't good. The Mars Civboot, which this one is trying to
replicate, has had three events in the last five years where each required at
least several month's worth of food. One of them required purging and
restarting almost the entire vertical farm, causing a loss of almost five
months of food. Of course, that was when there was a hull breach and the entire
farm was exposed to the Martian atmosphere, which couldn't happen here..." she
trails off a bit. Yes, we wouldn't loose our food, but none of us wanted to
think about what Earth's atmosphere was currently like.

"How much food do we produce?" I ask.

"I haven't checked" answers May "but we should be producing enough for fifteen
people. Any excess is simply put back in the compost. So storing extra food
shouldn't pose too much of a challenge."

Tay nodds, "Then do it. Let me know any way I can help. I've actually pickled
a fair amount of radishes and other vegetables to help make my mother's South
Korean recipes. Pickling some food sounds like just the right speed for me right
now." She changes her glance to me. "Now, for software there is one thing I want
more than anything and that is to be able to communicate with the other
Civboots. Especially Mars, which will have the best of the best experts. I've
been trying to get a connection on the satellite, but there seems to be some
kind of error."

She scribbles down a few notes on a piece of paper and hands it to me, "That
is the password which is supposed to give us access to the satellite. Your first
task from me as your leader is to make contact with the other Civboots."

Well, we did ask for a leader. I just wish she wouldn't make me do work.
