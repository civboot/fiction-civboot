TODO: need to make present tense.

When I came into the mess hall, the director of Civboot Alpha, Dr Jong was
already there sitting by herself; staring at a picture. She looked different
than I had remembered her. I had always thought her face was particularly
wrinkle free for someone in their lower sixties. In the last three months, her
face seemed to have aged ten years. Distinct wrinkles formed around the eyes of
a face that had, until now, rarely formed an expression.

Then the real difference struck me. Her face, wrinkled as it was, was again
more or less expressionless. Over the last months her expression had been like
the surface of a deep well of pain. It had been an expression I had avoided.
Avoided like I had avoided my own pain. I took my oatmeal and sat across from
her, silently eating. I was here... but I wasn't sure how to begin a
conversation. Everything had changed and the simple act of talking seemed
unfamiliar.

It was she who broke the silence. "A picture of my family" she said, sliding
the picture to me. "I've been staring at it almost continuously for the last
three months. It seems my tears have run out."

I took the picture. It was a three generation photo with at least sixteen
people in it, many of them little kids. "Your kids and grandchildren?"

She nodded. "Dead now of course. In heaven with almost everyone else." Then,
taking a deep breath "It's time I accept that. Time I move on."

A kind of silence hung in the air. Yup, I still don't know how to talk to
people.  Truth is I had never been good at discussing religion without being
offensive to others, and I found it particularly hard to understand how anyone
could believe in a biblical God now that Revelation had literally passed. The
apocalypse had come and gone, four horsemen and all. There was no City on a
Hill. No Jesus Christ descended from heaven. Just death, destruction and
despair.

"You and Maye seem to be doing better" she says, cutting the silence.

I took a sharp intake of breath, snapping out of my chain of thought. "Yes.
Better." I say, "Maye too. Like you said, its like the tears have dried out. I
feel...  mostly numb. Or at least like the part of my body that feels sadness
is numb. I'm able to taste food again, find some things funny... even if my
humor is a bit fucked up."

Dr Jong chuckled "A fucked up humor is healthy in a time like this. So too is
numbness. Few in history have ever experienced anything comparable. Maybe Noah
at the flood of the world? Yet despite the earth itself crying for 40 days and
nights, there was little mention of Noah's sadness. How are we supposed to feel?
Supposed to cope?" Her face took on an expression of almost anger "Fuck how we
are supposed to cope. Just let the feelings be what they are. All things come
and go. This too shall pass." It was said almost stoical, yet there was some
sadness. The well could never go completely dry.

"As a former Medical Commander in the Navy I thought myself pretty resilient"
she continued. "Nobody but a true sociopath could be resilient to what has
happened. As a doctor I try to remind myself the need to heal, that sometimes
healing can be more painful than the injury itself. Sometimes you never recover.
Or recovery means permanent change. We will never be the same again. But we must
try to continue, in whatever way we can."

More silence, this time less uncomfortable. We just sat, eating oatmeal for
several minutes. "So, what should we do?" I asked. She seemed like the right
person to ask. She was supposed to be the leader after all.

"I've been thinking that as well. Ah, speaking of Maye.." Maye had just entered
the mess hall looking tired, but still better than she had in months. She got
her oatmeal from the pot.

"You look better Dr Jong" Maye said, sitting next to me but leaving a
professional amount of space.

"Please, everyone should call me just Tay" she said, "unless they need a doctor
that is. Then just calling me Dr should get my attention. There are very few
people left alive, there is no need for hierarchies any longer."

"Tay then" said Maye, "but I disagree with you that we don't need hierarchies. I
very much want someone to be in charge and I feel that person should be you. I'm
tired of wallowing in this state of doing nothing. Toll and I have cleaned up
some of our mess over the last several months; what's next? I signed up for
being down here for three months. Will I now be underground for the rest of my
life? What's going to happen?"

Another silence fell. Tay and I had finished our oatmeal, so just sat back
slowly sipping coffee. It was a tough question that nobody had the answer to.

"Yes, you are probably right that we need a leader" said Tay. "I'm hurting just
like everyone else so I wish that didn't have to be me, but I've probably got
to be the one to bite the bullet and do it. First of all I don't think we should
push Carlos and Beth. Please give them whatever support comes naturally to you,
but let them heal in their own way. For now it will just be the three of us;
we'll do the best we can. Remind me again each of your specialties."

"I'm a computer science PhD" I said. "I'm not an expert in Civboot but I took
the programming training before coming down here. I've been pretty successful
in hacking their software... which means modifying it towards whatever ends I
want."

"Okay," said Tay "and how about you Maye?"

"I"m a bio-engineer in vertical farming, breeding, genetics and optimized food
production. I've also done some work with recycling difficult to process
industrial waste into compostable or manufacturable materials."

"Maye is leaving out that she's a fucking genius." I cut in. "She invented a
process whereby fungi consumes plastic waste and byproducts to become compost
for food. We literally couldn't have most of our plastics down here if it
weren't for her, since we wouldn't be able to truly recycle them."

Maye blushed slightly but didn't disagree. "Good said Tay. We're definitely
going to need to eat food and work with software, so I'm glad you have the
skills you do. My skills are mostly that I'm a medical doctor and know how
to be in charge. Hopefully we won't need to put my doctoring skills to work
any time soon. Anyway, what are your thoughts on first steps?"

Maye responded first. "I think we should try and store some extra food.
Our rations have been cut into significantly over the last several months,
with nobody harvesting the food. Fortunately the automated processes have
been simply re-composting it so nothing has broken, but we need to build up
a good store for when something goes wrong."

"What are the chances of that?" asks Tay.

"The chances aren't good. The Mars Civboot, which this one is trying to
replicate, has had three events in the last five years where each required at
least several month's worth of food. One of them required purging and
restarting almost the entire vertical farm, causing a loss of almost five
months of food. Of course, that was when there was a hull breach and the entire
farm was exposed to the Martian atmosphere, which couldn't happen here..." she
trailed off a bit. Yes, we wouldn't loose our food, but none of us wanted to
think about what Earth's atmosphere was currently like.

"How much food do we produce?" I ask.

"I haven't checked" answered May "but we should be producing enough for fifteen
people. Any excess is simply put back in the compost. So storing extra food
shouldn't pose too much of a challenge."

Tay nodded, "Then do it. Let me know any way I can help. I've actually pickled
a fair amount of daikon radish to help make my mother's South Korean recipes.
Pickling some food sounds like just the right speed." She changed her glance
to me "Now, for software there is one thing I want more than anything and that
is to be able to communicate with the other Civboots. Especially Mars,
which will have the best of the best for Civboot expertise. I've been trying to
get a connection on the satellite, but there seems to be some kind of error."

She scribbled down a few notes on a piece of paper and handed it to me, "That
is the password which is supposed to give us access to the satellite. Your first
task from me as your leader is to make contact with the other Civboots."
