# Segment 1

Toll awoke with a groan. Immediately the headache hit him, hammering into his
skull and forcing him to lay back down. He glanced around him, seeing the TV
of only blank digital static. He closed his eyes, wishing to go back to
sleep. "Please, give me back the nightmare I was having" he spoke into his
empty bunk tube. There was no response, not even an echo.

He lay in bed for another... how long was it? Twenty minutes? Did he doze? He
didn't know. When he did wake up again the headache was a little less and the
clock next to the TV said 11:15 AM. Wearily he sat up cross legged in the
confined space of the bunk tube. He tapped on the TV screen and it turned off.
He didn't know why he kept turning it on. Some kind of uncontrollable impulse.
Two large empty bottles lay at the end of his bed labeled "Celebration Wine".
He had stared at the blank TV last night, draining both bottles. He had never
been much of a drinker before, but there wasn't any choice now. The only
problem was, they were almost out of wine.

He rubbed sweat off his forehead in the chill air. His headache was less, but
it was still brutal. He took out three aspirin from a drawer and swallowed them
with the last remaining dregs of wine. Wearily he opened the hatch to his tube
bunk and dropped the three feet which was the entrance of Jamie's bunk... no,
what _had_ been Jamie's bunk. He was dead now wasn't he. Toll let out a small
sob, triggering his stomach to turn and the aspirin he had just taken to come
out onto the floor. It was going to be another shitty day.

After his stomach felt like it was done vomiting, Toll mechanically moved to
the bathroom to wash out his mouth and do his business. The pee stung as it
trickled out. "Must drink more water" he said to nobody, but the thought of
it turned his stomach again and he nearly vomited again. Instead of water
he took an anti-nausea pill from the medicine cabinet and held it under his
tongue. As the nausea passed he thought again of the surface. Of all the
people now dead. He started to wish for the nausea, or anything else, that
could help him forget.

Nearly three months he'd been like this, going off and on between drinking
heavily and doing anything he could to numb himself. He wasn't sure how long he
could stay alive in this state of perpetual despair. Jamie had killed himself
on the second day.  The knowledge that his family had been incinerated in one
of the first rounds of H Bombs had put him first into a kind of stasis. Toll
hadn't even seen the man cry. There was just two days of shock followed by a
rope around his neck and his body hanging from a pipe.

They had held a kind of funeral, the five of them who were left. It had felt
like a funeral for all civilization, although at that time they hadn't known
how much worse it could get. The funeral had been pretty pathetic, mostly
silent sobs with a few words to Jamie's credit. Then they had put his body in
the industrial composer. There wasn't anywhere else to put him. Everyone
thought of maybe joining him, letting their particles dissolve back into the
microbial and mycenaean matter we all came out of. But nobody else did. Everyone
just walked away and dealt with the immense loss of a colleague and their entire
civilization in their own way. Some cried in each other's arms, spiritually
naked and empty. Some drank until they were numb. No humans in history had
grieved like this, grieved for their entire species. There really was nothing
else that could be done.

From what could be gathered from the TV and the rare reports from NASA
headquarters, an H Bomb had somehow been detonated in North Korea. Nobody
knew who detonated it, although it was postulated that it had been an accident
and North Korea had accidentally detonated one of their own. Regardless,
what happened next was far, far worse. Some software routine with a bug of
cataclysmic consequences noticed the detonation and starting sending out nukes
of it's own from China.  This software was supposed to have been verified and
tested to not do this for a single detonation under any circumstances, since
the designers _knew_ the possibilities of accidental detonation. They also
knew the consequences of sending nukes over half the world: mutually assured
destruction. More H Bombs coming out of china triggered other software to
behave exactly as intended, turning the cities of China into a field of glass.
China's software, noticing the incoming Nucs returned the favor to the rest of
the world.

This was when Jamie had committed suicide. He had been lucky to do it so early,
because what happened next was more horrifying than the initial destruction.
One of H Bombs must have damaged one of the bio engineering facilities only
discussed in horror novels. It released some kind of disease, possibly the
worst disease humanity could possibly conceive. Why whoever had not only
conceived it but actually built it was not made clear in the panicked television
broadcasts, but what was clear were these facts: (1) the disease was basically
the AIDS virus. (2) the disease had no symptoms for more than a month. (3) the
disease was insanely contagious via the air. Simply being within several feet
of a person was enough to become infected. (4) nobody was immune to the virus.

Just like AIDS the virus did not kill you directly, it simply shut down your
immune system until you eventually succumbed any bacteria or virus that came
along, even the bacteria that had been happily growing on your own skin. Nobody
had even known there _was_ a virus until several weeks in, and with people
flocking to every corner of the earth trying to find food and escape the mass
panic, the virus spread to basically every human being on Earth. That is, every
human except those living in bunkers designed to replicate the environments
of those living on Mars. Which was exactly where Toll and his previously five,
now four, colleagues found themselves.

It was a Civboot, a piece of technology which had the tools to rebuild every
component within itself from raw materials. It could produce computer chips.
It could produce all of the components in machines like drills or robots.
It recycled food, water and oxygen in vertical farms, powered by geothermal
energy from deep below the surface of the earth. It was exactly the kind
of place you would want to find yourself in the apocalypse. Which was exactly
where Toll did find himself.

So everyone started dying and eventually all contact with the surface was lost.
The final reports had been images of empty cities, what few hadn't been nuked
to glass. Oil wells spewing crude into the oceans. Fires across the earth with
a blackened sky. Destruction. Death. Despair. Destruction. Death. Despair.

"Destruction. Death. Despair. Destruction. Death. Despair."

Toll slapped himself in the face to prevent him from repeating the words again.
Mayn glanced up at him from the sound and Toll noticed for the first time there
weren't tears or dark circles under her eyes. She wrapped a big hug around him,
holding him tightly, her face nestled in his chest. Her hands massaged up and
down his back. The touch and pressure started to release some his tension, a
gentle sign escaped his mouth, some of his built up stress and pain lessening.

"A bit better?" Mayn asked. Her eyes looked sharp again, her muscles more
relaxed.

"Yes" Toll responded. Over the past several months there had been bursts of
physical contact broken by long stretches of forced solitude. Norms around
touch that had been built up over a lifetime had suddenly collapsed in the well
of sadness they now found themselves. Nearly animal instincts had replaced the
carefully practiced social dance. They were like animals trying to find shelter
from a hurricane of despair. Toll could blearily remember the intimate contact
he had shared with Maye, how there had been no thought put into it. How it had
felt not exactly good or bad. Barely even a relief of tension.

He took her in his arms again. His muscles tensed to hug tightly,
simultaneously releasing built-up tension elsewhere. It felt good to be here.
It felt good to have someone to hug. It felt good to be alive. It felt good to
have medicated relief from the headache and nausea.

After a long time they released each other and went into the kitchen to make
breakfast. Maye started boiling some water then took a liter of dry oatmeal
from the cabinet and set it on the counter.

She bit her lip, as if to try and stop the words but then said. "I know I've
said this before, but I think we have to let go of... let go of the surface.
There isn't anything that we can do any more. We have to keep... have to
start..."

She trailed off. She had said it before, we have to start moving again. Start
living again. We were the only ones that were left... well us and the other
five Civboots scattered around the earth... then the one on Mars... maybe
some people in bunkers, or far out in the country? Maybe even some had been
immune to the disease? But not many. Certainly not many. We were all that was
left.

It had always acted to only deepen Toll's sadness. To remind him of what was
lost. What would never be returned. He didn't have kids, but he had known many
people on the surface. There were deep connections that had now been severed.
With his parents and brother. With his best friends. With his ex-girlfriends,
one of which he had continued a friendship with and had always hoped to marry
one day.

This time was different, something lifted. He only nodded, noticing surprise on
Maye's face. He was surprised himself. He could feel a large part of the tension
lifting. There wasn't any reason this time should be different. Maybe after
months of despair his psychology was healing. He recalled hearing that humans
are more resilient than people think and can heal from any practically any
tragedy within as little as three months. Perhaps that was him. Perhaps he was
finally healing.

They sat down next to each other with their oatmeal, it's warmth felt good in
Toll's stomach.  "So as I was saying," continued Maye "we need to start living
again. Start _doing_ something... I'm just not sure what we should do. We can't
go to...  go to the surface. At least not yet! But we shouldn't just stay down
here and mope either."

Toll finished chewing his oatmeal. "It sounds reasonable, I just don't know
what we can do. Over the past two weeks the biggest concern I've had is that we
are going to run out of wine."

"It's not just wine! This facility is not completely automated you know. Some
of the vertical farms and manufacturing is automated, but it is our job to
actually move the food to refrigeration and prepare it in meals. There are
other things too" she said vaguely, waving her hands "like doing maintenance
checks, changing the air filters, transferring the compost..." she trailed off,
the thought of Jaime's body sitting in said compost stopping her short. In not
terribly long Jaime's corpse would be incorporated into their food. The circle
of life, normally a comforting thought fell short in this instance.

"Anyway" she continued, "we should start doing some work if for no other reason
than work is good for us. Having something to do will help us all feel better."

"I'm still wondering whether I even want to feel better" Toll said "or whether
I just want to follow Jaime's lead."

"Don't do that!" she yelled in anger. "Don't do that... we need you. I need
you!" she started crying, her tear free cheeks flooding freely "I've already
lost the world, I can't loose you too. I can't loose another friend. Not now.
Please don't say that."

"I won't do it" Toll said, putting his arm around her and holding her body
close to his "but I can't say I don't think about it. I think we are all
thinking about it. It's one of the few coherent thoughts I have now, one of the
few things that reminds me I'm still here." She put her face into his shoulder,
her sobs beginning to lessen. His hand moved up, stroking the hair on her
forehead away. "Don't worry about me, I'm not going anywhere. I think you're
right, we need to start doing something. But let's leave it at that for the
day? I feel tired again and want to lye down." Toll pushed his oatmeal away,
only half eaten. The kitchen was a mess, full of half eaten food poorly
cleaned.

She was right of course, they would at least have to start cleaning properly.
Cooking real food again, taking care of the vertical farm. And then there was
the problem that they were living in a Tin can 1,000 meters below the surface
of the earth. And not just any Tin can, a _prototype_ Tin can with
"improvements" meant for Mars. Improvements they were supposed to be testing on
the relative safety of Earth. Oh, they would have problems -- that was true
enough. It had been their jobs to iron out any kinks in the hardware, software
and mechanisms so that it could be sent to Mars. Now it wasn't just a job, it
was what their lives depended on.
