I take one last long look at the sky, the clouds drifting lazily across it's
blue expanse, before stepping into the ragged looking mining elevator. For the
next two years I'm going to be a new resident in NASA's Midwestern Civboot,
"Civboot Alpha". One of six international Civboots, it was buried under 1000
meters of rock in an abandoned mine for the purpose of replicating the
experience of the Martian colony, to validate new technology which would soon be
shipped to the Mars Civboot. The Mars Civboot was made up of more than fifty
people from four different nations: the United States, China, Russia and Europe.
The US had two terrestrial Civboots and each other nation had one.

The mining elevator gave a lurch and started to descend. I took a look at the
man next to me in his upper fifties, named John. He had introduced himself as an
old NASA Test Engineer who advanced up the tech ladder and was now near
retirement, working on the Mars Civboot project and brining new recruits to the
test sites.

My own career at NASA is much briefer. It's my third year, my previous time
spent almost entirely on the gravitational and radio telescope array of more
than four thousand satellites in orbit around the Sun. By utilizing all four
thousand satellites as one gigantic telescope, spread out with a surface area
greater than Jupiter, we enabled extreme precision gravitational and radio wave
measurements further than a contained telescope could ever hope to reach.

John spoke "May I ask why the change in career?".

I had requested the transfer to Civboot six months ago. To be honest it was
because I had felt a lack of purpose since leaving grad school. I had hoped it
would go away when I got my PhD, or surely when I was doing "real work," but it
never had.

"Since I was a child I always wanted to be an astronaut and visit other
planets. Working in a Civboot is program is supposed to be a good way to get
your place on Mars."

John nodded, giving a rough cough. "I've lead many future Mars colonists down
this elevator" I've also taken many people nearly driven crazy from isolation
back up. Lucky for them actually; Mars would have been worse. Far worse. On
Mars you can 'check in any time you like but you can never leave'" he finished
with a flourish, quoting the old song and giving a chuckle to himself. It wasn't
quite true, there were return flights from Mars. But they were only every two
years during the launch window, just before the Earth-Mars opposition when the
two planets were closest. And the journey back could take over a year of
isolated space flight.

I just nodded in response. As part of my three month Civboot training I had been
put in complete isolation for two weeks, followed by a full psych evaluation. I
had always been an introvert and did not have many problems with being shut away
with books and a laptop. I didn't think I would be someone to snap down here.
Then again two years was a long time.

The terrestrial Civboots were each staffed with five to ten people. Civboot
Alpha would house six once Toll arrived. He had read the personnel files of the
other five residents; there were to be three women and three men for at least
the next year. Each resident brought a specific expertise to analyze new
Civboot technology. The experts included a medical doctor who was also the site
lead, a mechanical engineer, two bio engineers, a computer hardware engineer
and myself: a software engineer with a PhD in Computer Science.

Not that my PhD would help much for Civboot. My expertise was mostly in
theoretical mathematical calculations on modern hardware. Civboot was an
entirely different beast, made almost entirely from computer parts that could
have been built in 1985. This archaism was a feature, not a bug. Civboot,
meaning "Civilizational bootstrapper", had all the tools and technology to
re-build itself from scratch, including all the computer chips, machines and
materials necessary. For the Mars colony to be able to survive the two year
transfer windows and six month flight for new supplies, it was necessary for it
to be able to replace, modify or re-engineer nearly every part within it.
Civboot was the only technology stack small and simple enough to be be
understood and replicated by as few as fifty experts, even with help from NASA
engineers on earth.

There were few other words between us as we rode the elevator down. Down. Down.
When we reached the bottom John spoke "Now pay attention and stay close. The
Civboot is actually hidden in a maze of tunnels down here. The bureaucrats at
NASA think it is some kind of secret bunker which could save the human race in
the event of catastrophe, or at least that's what people want now a days. I say
it's all bullshit -- if the surface bit the bucket then the Civboots would be
soon to follow. But what do I know, I just deal with risk as my day job". John
let out another brutal cough.

We walked through a few tunnels and I strained to remember them, quickly loosing
my way. "So it's hidden in case what... in case there is a social breakdown?
They want the Civboot to be able to survive an technological dark age or
something?"

"Ya, bunch of bullshit. They gave the same justification for the huge
expenditure on the Mars colony. Back in the good ole' days we spent money on
science and exploration for the sake of knowledge. Now everyone needs something
more real, like we're making a computer backup of the human race. Crock load
of shit, there's no apocalypse coming." He paused, giving a wink "But if
there were, you would be in the best place for it."

We arrived at the Civboot, a rusty flat iron door cut directly into the rock
wall. John waved his ID card in front of a more silvery section of the door and
I could hear gears grinding behind it before it opened.

"Well that's the end of the road for me" said John, handing me his personal bag
and shaking his hand. "I wish you the best of luck down here. You let us know if
there's anything we can do for you. Chances are, we can't." He gave a
chuckle.

*Bastard* I thought, but I thanked him anyway before walking through the door.

Just inside was a woman in her upper fifties. I guessed it to be Dr Jong, the
head of Civboot Alpha. "Welcome to Alpha" said Dr Jong. She advanced towards
me, her arms outstretched, giving me a full body hug. I returned it stiffly,
surprised. Dr Jong chuckled "I assume you were made aware of our custom of
greeting with a hug."

"Yes, sorry" I said, "It's just something I'm not used to."

"Treat it like a custom in a foreign country. Except, it  was created for
medical reasons. You see, a few hugs a day have been proven to reduce stress,
anxiety and a host of other neurosis more effectively than medications. And with
zero side effects."

Dr Jong becomned me to follow. "We'll introduce you to the crew in a bit.
First let me show you around."

The hallway we were walking through was basically a long tube easily four
meters in diameter. The bottom was flat, made of a wood-like material. It had
pipes running on the right side. "I'm surprised how spacious things feel. This
hallway feels big, much bigger than a normal hallway. I had expected it to be
more confining."

"Yes, there are two reasons for that. The first is the same reason as why we
give hugs. The human psyche is not used to living underground, so tricking it
with space and light can aid our psychological well-being considerably. The
second is that almost every hallway and room in the Civboot was drilled using
the exact same drill. This helps reduce the number of tools needed to build or
expand a Civboot. Reducing the number of thirty ton drills you need to bring to
Mars is good, all things being equal."

"How to reduce what must be taken to Mars and how to keep people from going
insane are probably the two major design constraints for most elements in the
Mars Civboot." She continued. "This is our Mess hall."

Like the hallway, it was a four meter wide cylinder, but on the right side was a
table with benches that could seat at least fifteen people. At the end was a
full kitchen with a sink, industrial washing machine, stove, oven, counter tops and
refrigerators. I noticed the whole facility so far had been perfectly clean and
made a mental note to make an effort in that direction. I'm normally a complete
slob.

Dr Jong continued touring the facility. I met three of the other residents,
greeting them with full hugs as well. The custom was already growing on me.
When they arrived at the vertical farms, a woman in her mid thirties was
working, inspecting a plant under a microscope. When she heard us approach she
looked up.

"This is Maye. Maye, this is Toll Bansha our new resident software engineer."
Maye stayed sitting, I Toll greeted her with a handshake which she returned with
a smile.

"Good to meet you" she said. "Once you're settled I think I need some help with
the auto harvester. Jamie and I think it has a software issue when harvesting
the raspberries and it would be good if someone could take a look."

"I can certainly try" I replied, a little put off by her bluntness. I also felt
uncomfortable, not knowing how much I could really help. I had learned a little
bit of Civboot software in my three month training, but had never even seen a
harvester. "Hopefully I could help at least confirm it's a software bug, then
NASA can help determine the fix." There was a team of at least fifty engineers
tasked with helping to solve any issues the Civboot had, as well as review and
verify any code or design changes made. Their top priority was always Mars, but
Toll had been told they could typically help with even small problems within a
day or two.

"Excellent, sounds like a plan" broke in Dr Jong. "Toll, why don't I take you
to your bunk and let you get settled. We all eat in the mess hall at 6:00 PM.
You can get started on this work in the morning."

I waved goodbye to Maye and followed Dr Jong back to my bunk. It was a square
box made of some kind of durable white plastic, more than two meters long, a
meter tall and a meter wide. The hallway we were in branched off the main one
and was a lot more constrained than the others, the room was composed of exactly
about thirty bunks, sixteen on bottom and fourteen on top in a honeycombe
pattern.

"This is your personal bunk, next to you is Jamie. Nobody occupies the top
bunks, so you can use the one above you for storage if you like. The bunks are
completely noise isolated. There is no lock, but I can promise that nobody will
ever go in it. The drawers inside have a clean set of uniforms for you to
change into and space for your personal affects. This is the primary private
space availble to you, but there are also two environmental viewing rooms which
can play a variety of natural environments as well as music. If you want one,
you need to schedule it, as they are frequently occupied."

I said thanks. She gave me another hug and left to do some other duties. I
changed into the Civboot uniform, essentially durable khakis and a T-shirt, pair
of socks, work boots made of a synthetic leather and even Civboot underwear.
There was also a personal electronic device, something that looked like a large
wrist watch. It had several buttons and could also come unhooked from my wrist
to fold out a thumb keypad. Like many things in the Civboot it looked like it
had been made in the 80's but designed by someone from the present who was
obsessed with minimalism.

I got inside my bunk and removed my civilian clothing, stashing it at the
bottom of my personal effects. "Won't be needing these anymore" I said to
myself, putting the Civboot uniform on. I felt odd and decided to lay down, trying
to gauge my feelings. Sad... alone... maybe a little scared. "What the fuck
have I got myself into" I spoke into the noise isolated bunk. I felt like I was
a prisoner. A prisoner in a prison with lots of hugs, nerds and vintage tech.
Deep, deep, deep underground. Was this really what I wanted? Was _this_
something that would really help me to feel less empty inside?
