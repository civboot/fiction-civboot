Toll took one last long look at the sky, the clouds drifting lazily across it's
blue expanse, before stepping into the ragged looking mining elevator. For the next
two years he was going to be a new resident in NASA's Midwestern Civboot,
"Civboot Alpha". One of six international Civboots, it was buried under 1000
meters of rock in an abandoned mine for the purpose of replicating the
experience of the Martian colony, to validate new technology which would soon
be shipped to the Mars Civboot. The Mars Civboot was made up of more than fifty
people from four different nations: the United States, China, Russia and
Europe. The US had two terrestrial Civboots and each other nation had one.

The mining elevator gave a lurch and started to descend. The man escorting
Toll, named John, was in his upper fifties. An old NASA Test Engineer who
advanced up the tech ladder and was now near retirement, he now worked on the
Mars Civboot project and helped bring new recruits to the test sites. Toll
had been at NASA for almost three years but never worked with John. Toll had
been working on the gravitational and radio telescope array of more than four
thousand satellites in orbit around the Sun. By utilizing all four thousand
satellites as one gigantic telescope, spread out with a surface area greater
than Jupiter, it enabled extreme precision gravitational and radio wave
measurements of any point in the sky.

"May I ask why the change in career?" John inquired. Toll had requested the
transfer to Civboot six months ago. Somewhere during grad school he had felt a
sense of emptiness and lack of purpose. He thought that if he just pushed
through it he would be fine after he got his PhD, but the emptiness never left
him. Nor did it leave him when he got the job at NASA.

"Since I was a child I always wanted to be an astronaut and visit other
planets. Performing well in this program is supposed to be a good way to get
your place on Mars."

"I've lead many future Mars colonists down this elevator it is true. I've also
taken many people nearly driven crazy from isolation back up. Lucky for them
actually; Mars would have been worse. Far worse. On Mars you can 'check in any
time you like but you can never leave'" he finished with a flourish, quoting
the old song and giving a chuckle to himself. It wasn't quite true, there were
return flights from Mars. But they were only every two years during the launch
window, just before the Earth-Mars opposition when the two planets were
closest.

Toll nodded. As part of his three month Civboot training he had been put in
complete isolation for two weeks, followed by a full psych evaluation. He had
always been an introverted person and did not have many problems with being
shut away with books and a laptop. He didn't think he would be someone to snap
down here. Then again two years was a long time.

The terrestrial Civboots were each staffed with five to ten people. Civboot
Alpha would house six once Toll arrived. He had read the personnel files of the
other five residents; there were to be three women and three men for at least
the next year. Each resident brought a specific expertise to analyze new
Civboot technology. The experts included a medical doctor who was also the site
lead, a mechanical engineer, two bio engineers, a computer hardware engineer
and himself: a software engineer with a PhD in Computer Science.

Not that his PhD would help much for Civboot. His expertise was mostly in
theoretical mathematical calculations on modern hardware. Civboot was an
entirely different beast, made almost entirely from computer parts that could
have been built in 1980. This was a feature not a bug. Civboot, meaning
"Civilizational bootstrapper", had all the tools and technology to re-build
itself from scratch, including all the computer chips, machines and materials
necessary. For the Mars colony to be able to survive the two year transfer
windows and six month flight for new supplies, it was necessary for it to be
able to replace, modify or re-engineer nearly every part within it. Civboot was
the only technology stack small and simple enough to be be understood and
replicated by as few as fifty experts.

There were few other words between them as they rode the elevator down. Down.
Down. When they reached the bottom John spoke "Now pay attention and stay
close. The Civboot is actually hidden in a maze of tunnels down here. The
bureaucrats at NASA think it is some kind of secret bunker which could save the
human race in the event of catastrophe, or at least that's what people want now
a days. I say it's all bullshit -- if the surface bit the bucket then the
Civboots would be soon to follow. But what do I know."

They walked through a few tunnels, Toll trying to remember them. "So it's
hidden in case what... in case there is a social breakdown? They want the
Civboot to be able to survive an technological dark age or something?"

"Ya, bunch of bullshit. They gave the same justification for the huge
expenditure on the Mars colony. Back in the good ole' days we spent money on
science and exploration for the sake of knowledge. Now everyone needs to
have a backup. Bunch of hullabaloo, there's no apocalypse coming." He paused,
giving a wink "But if there were, you would be in the best place for it."

They arrived at the Civboot, a rusty flat iron door cut directly into the rock
wall. John waved his ID card in front of a discolored rock and Toll could hear
gears grinding behind it before it opened.

"Well that's the end of the road for me" John said, handing Toll his personal
bag and shaking his hand. "I wish you the best of luck down here. You let us
know if there's anything we can do for you. Chances are, we can't." He gave a
chuckle.

*Bastard* thought Toll, but he thanked him anyway before walking through the door.

Just inside was a woman in her upper fifties. Toll guessed it to be Dr Jong,
the head of Civboot Alpha. "Welcome to Alpha, Toll" said Dr Jong. She advanced
towards him, her arms outstretched, giving him a full body hug. Toll returned
it stiffly, surprised. Dr Jong chuckled "I assume you were made aware of our
custom of greeting with a hug."

"Yes, sorry" said Toll, "It's just something I'm not used to."

"Treat it like a custom in a foreign country. Except, it  was created for
medical reasons. You see, a few hugs a day have been proven to reduce stress,
anxiety and a host of other neurosis more effectively than many medications."

"And I bet with fewer side effects" joked Toll.

Dr Jong just gave a polite smile. "We'll introduce you to the crew in a bit.
First let me show you around." While they walked she asked "do you have any
questions?"

The hallway they were walking through was basically a long tube easily four
meters in diameter. The bottom was flat, made of a wood-like material. It has
pipes running on the right side. "I'm surprised how spacious things feel" said
Toll. "This hallway feels big. Much bigger than a normal hallway anyway. I had
expected it to be more confining."

"Yes, that is a result of two things. The first is the same reason as the hugs.
The human psyche is not used to living underground, so tricking it with space
and light can help our psychological well-being considerably. The second is that
almost every hallway and room in the Civboot was drilled using the exact same
drill. This helps reduce the number of tools needed to build or expand a
Civboot. Reducing the number of thirty ton drills you need to bring to Mars is
good, all things being equal."

She stopped in front of what looked like the mess hall. She continued, "How to
reduce what must be taken to Mars and how to keep people from going insane are
probably the two major design constraints for many elements in the Mars
Civboot." She waved a hand behind her, "this is our Mess hall." 

Like the hallway, it was a four meter wide cylinder, but on the right side was a
table with benches that could seat at least fifteen people. At the end was a
full kitchen with a sink, industrial washing machine, stove, oven, counter tops and
refrigerators. Toll noticed the whole facility so far had been perfectly clean
and made a mental note that he would have to be as well. Since he was something
of a slob, this would take a lot of effort.

Dr Jong continued touring the facility. Toll met three of the other residents,
greeting them with full hugs as he had with Dr Jong. The custom was already
growing on him. When they arrived at the vertical farms, a woman in her mid
thirties was working, inspecting some pieces of a plant under a microscope.
When she heard them approach she looked up.

"This is Maye. Maye, this is Toll Bansha our new resident software engineer."
Maye stayed sitting, so Toll greeted her with a handshake which she returned
with a smile.

"Good to meet you" she said. "Once you're settled I think I need some help with
the auto harvester. Jamie and I think it has a software issue when harvesting
the raspberries and it would be good if someone could take a look."

"I can certainly try" said Toll, but he didn't know how much he could help. He
had learned a little bit of Civboot software in his three month training, but
had never even seen a harvester. "Hopefully I could help at least confirm it's a
software bug, then NASA can help determine the fix." There was a team of at
least fifty engineers tasked with helping to solve any issues the Civboot had,
as well as review and verify any code or design changes made. Their top
priority was always Mars, but Toll had been told they could typically help
with even small problems within a day or two.

"Excellent, sounds like a plan" broke in Dr Jong. "Toll, why don't I take you
to your bunk and let you get settled. We all eat in the mess hall at 6:00 PM.
You can get started on this work in the morning."

Toll waved goodbye to Maye and followed Dr Jong back to his bunk. It was a
square box made of some kind of durable white plastic, more than two meters
long, a meter tall and a meter wide. The hallway they were in shot off the
main one and was a lot more constrained than the others, the room taken up
by about thirty bunks in rows.

"This is your personal bunk, below you is Jamie. Before you ask, the bunks are
completely noise isolated. There is no lock, but I can promise that nobody will
ever go in it. The drawers inside have a clean set of uniforms for you to
change into and space for your personal affects. This is the primary private
space availble to you, but there are also two some environmental viewing rooms
which can play a variety of natural environments as well as music. If you want
one, you need to schedule it, as they are occupied very frequently."

Toll said thanks, feeling she had to go. She gave him another hug and left to do
her other duties. Toll changed into the Civboot uniform, essentially durable
khakis and a T-shirt, pair of socks, work boots made of a synthetic leather and
even Civboot underwear. There was also  a personal electronic device, something
that looked like a large wrist watch. It had several buttons and could also
come unhooked from your wrist to fold out a thumb keypad. Like many things in
the Civboot it looked like it had been made in the 80's but designed by a
person from the present.

Toll got inside his bunk and removed his civilian clothing, stashing it at the
bottom of his personal effects. He wouldn't be needing it any more. He put the
Civboot uniform on, feeling a sense of oddness when done. He lay back, trying
to gauge his feelings. Sad... alone... maybe a little scared. "What the fuck
have I got myself into" he said to the empty bunk. He felt as if he had chosen
to become a prisoner. A prisoner in a prison with lots of hugs and vintage tech
and which was deep, deep, deep underground. Was this really what he wanted? Was
_this_ something that would really help him to feel less empty inside?
