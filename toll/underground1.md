I take one last long look at the sky, the clouds drifting lazily across it's
blue expanse, before stepping into the ragged looking mining elevator. For the
next two years I'm going to be a new resident in NASA's Midwestern Civboot,
"Civboot Alpha". One of six international Civboots, it was buried under 1000
meters of rock in an abandoned mine for the purpose of replicating the
experience of the Martian colony, to validate new technology which would soon be
shipped to the Mars Civboot. The Mars Civboot was made up of more than fifty
people from four different nations: the United States, China, Russia and Europe.
The US had two terrestrial Civboots and each other nation had one.

The mining elevator gives a lurch and starts to descend. I take a look at the
man next to me. He's shorter, in upper fifties with a trimed beard peppered with
black. He had introduced himself as John, an old NASA Test Engineer who advanced
up the tech ladder and was now near retirement, working on the Mars Civboot
project and brining new recruits to the test sites.

My career at NASA has been much briefer. It's my third year, my previous time
spent almost entirely on the gravitational and radio telescope array of more
than four thousand satellites in orbit around the Sun. By utilizing all four
thousand satellites as one gigantic telescope, spread out with a surface area
greater than Jupiter, we enabled extreme precision gravitational and radio wave
measurements further than a contained telescope could ever hope to reach.

"May I ask why the change in career?" asks John.

I had requested the transfer to Civboot six months ago. To be honest it was
because I had felt a lack of purpose since leaving grad school. I had hoped it
would go away when I got my PhD, or surely when I was doing "real work," but it
never had.

"Since I was a child I always wanted to be an astronaut and visit other planets.
Working at a Civboot is supposed to be a good way to get your place on Mars."

John nods, giving a rough cough. "I've lead many future Mars colonists down
this elevator" I've also taken many people nearly driven crazy from isolation
back up. Lucky for them actually; Mars would have been worse. Far worse. On
Mars you can 'check in any time you like but you can never leave'" he finishes
with a flourish, quoting the old song and giving a chuckle to himself. It wasn't
quite true, there were return flights from Mars. But they were only every two
years during the launch window, just before the Earth-Mars opposition when the
two planets were closest. And the journey back could take over a year of
isolated space flight.

I just nod in response. As part of my three month Civboot training I had been
put in complete isolation for two weeks, followed by a full psych evaluation. I
had always been an introvert and did not have many problems with being shut away
with books and a laptop. I didn't think I would be someone to snap down here.
Then again two years was a long time.

The terrestrial Civboots were each staffed with five to ten people. Civboot
Alpha would house six once Toll arrived. He had read the personnel files of the
other five residents; there were to be three women and three men for at least
the next year. Each resident brought a specific expertise to analyze new
Civboot technology. The experts included a medical doctor who was also the site
lead, a mechanical engineer, two bio engineers, a computer hardware engineer
and myself: a software engineer with a PhD in Computer Science.

Not that my PhD would help much for Civboot. My expertise was mostly in
theoretical mathematical calculations on modern hardware. Civboot was an
entirely different beast, made almost entirely from computer parts that could
have been built in 1985. This archaism was a feature, not a bug. Civboot,
meaning "Civilizational bootstrapper", had all the tools and technology to
re-build itself from scratch, including all the computer chips, machines and
materials necessary. For the Mars colony to be able to survive the two year
transfer windows and six month flight for new supplies, it was necessary for it
to be able to replace, modify or re-engineer nearly every part within it.
Civboot was the only technology stack small and simple enough to be be
understood and replicated by as few as fifty experts, even with help from NASA
engineers on earth.

There were few other words between us as we rode the elevator down. Down. Down.
When we reach the bottom John says "Now pay attention and stay close. The
Civboot is actually hidden in a maze of tunnels down here. The bureaucrats at
NASA think it is some kind of secret bunker which could save the human race in
the event of catastrophe, or at least that's what people want now a days. I say
it's all bullshit -- if the surface bit the bucket then the Civboots would be
soon to follow. But what do I know, I just deal with risk as my day job". John
lets out another brutal cough.

We walk through a few tunnels and I strain to remember them, quickly loosing my
way. "So it's hidden in case what... in case there is a social breakdown? They
want the Civboot to be able to survive an technological dark age or something?"

"Ya, bunch of bullshit. They gave the same justification for the huge
expenditure on the Mars colony. Back in the good ole' days we spent money on
science and exploration for the sake of knowledge. Now everyone needs something
more real, like we're making a computer backup of the human race. Crock load
of shit, there's no apocalypse coming." He pauses, giving a wink "But if there
were, you would be in the best place for it."

We arrive at the Civboot, a rusty flat iron door cut directly into the rock
wall. John waves his ID card in front of a more silvery section of the door and
I hear gears grinding behind it before it opens.

"Well that's the end of the road for me" says John, handing me his personal bag
and shaking his hand. "I wish you the best of luck down here. You let us know if
there's anything we can do for you. Chances are, we can't." He gives a chuckle.

*Bastard* I think, but I thank him anyway before walking through the door.

Just inside is a woman in her upper fifties. I guess it to be Dr Jong, the head
of Civboot Alpha. "Welcome to Alpha" says Dr Jong. She advances towards me, her
arms outstretched, giving me a full body hug. I return it stiffly, surprised. Dr
Jong chuckles "I assume you were made aware of our custom of greeting with a
hug."

"Yes, sorry" I say, "It's just something I'm not used to."

"Treat it like a custom in a foreign country. Except, it  was created for
medical reasons. You see, a few hugs a day have been proven to reduce stress,
anxiety and a host of other neurosis more effectively than medications. And with
zero side effects."

Dr Jong becons me to follow. "We'll introduce you to the crew in a bit.
First let me show you around."

The hallway we walk through is a long tube easily four meters in diameter. The
bottom is flat, made of a wood-like material. It has pipes running on the right
side. "I'm surprised how spacious things feel. This hallway feels big, much
bigger than a normal hallway. I had expected it to be more confining."

"Yes, there are two reasons for that. The first is the same reason as why we
give hugs. The human psyche is not used to living underground, so tricking it
with space and light can aid our psychological well-being considerably. The
second is that almost every hallway and room in the Civboot was drilled using
the exact same drill. This helps reduce the number of tools needed to build or
expand a Civboot. Reducing the number of thirty ton drills you need to bring to
Mars is good, all things being equal."

"How to reduce what must be taken to Mars and how to keep people from going
insane are probably the two major design constraints for most elements in the
Mars Civboot." She continues. "This is our Mess hall."

Like the hallway, it is a four meter wide cylinder, but on the right side is a
table with benches that could seat at least fifteen people. At the end is a
full kitchen with a sink, industrial washing machine, stove, oven, counter tops and
refrigerators. I notice the whole facility so far has been perfectly clean and
make a mental note. I'm normally a complete slob.

Dr Jong continues touring the facility. I meet three other residents, greeting
them with full hugs as well. The custom is already growing on me. When we
arrive at the vertical farm, a woman in her mid thirties is there inspecting a
plant under a microscope. When she hears us approach she looks up.

"This is Maye. Maye, this is Toll Bansha our new resident software engineer."
Maye stays sitting, I greet her with a handshake which she returns curtly.

"Good to meet you" she says. "Once you're settled I think I need some help with
the auto harvester. Jamie and I think it has a software issue when harvesting
the raspberries and it would be good if someone could take a look."

"I can certainly try" I replied, a little put off by her bluntness. I also feel
uncomfortable, not knowing how much I can really help. I had learned a little
bit of Civboot software in my three month training, but have never even seen a
harvester. "Hopefully I could help at least confirm it's a software bug, then
NASA can help determine the fix." There's a team of at least fifty engineers
tasked with helping to solve any issues the Civboot has, as well as review and
verify any code or design changes made. Their top priority is always Mars, but
they can also help us when we need them.

"Excellent, sounds like a plan" breaks in Dr Jong. "Toll, why don't I take you
to your bunk and let you get settled. We all eat in the mess hall at 6:00 PM.
You can get started on this work in the morning."

I wave goodbye to Maye and follow Dr Jong back to my bunk. When we get there I
take a long look. It is a square box made of some kind of durable white plastic,
more than two meters long, a meter tall and a meter wide. The hallway like room
we are in is branched off the main loop and is full from floor to ceiling of
thirty bunks. There are sixteen on bottom and fourteen on top in a honeycombe
pattern.

"This is your personal bunk, next to you is Jamie. Nobody occupies the top
bunks, so you can use the one above you for storage if you like. The bunks are
completely noise isolated. There is no lock, but I can promise that nobody will
ever go in it. The drawers inside have a clean set of uniforms for you to
change into and space for your personal affects. This is the primary private
space availble to you, but there are also two environmental viewing rooms which
can play a variety of natural environments as well as music. If you want one,
you need to schedule it, as they are frequently occupied."

I say thanks. She gives me another hug and leaves to do some other duties. I
change into the Civboot uniform, essentially durable khakis and a T-shirt, pair
of socks, work boots made of a synthetic leather and even Civboot underwear.
There is also a personal electronic device, something that looks like a large
wrist watch. It has several buttons and can also come unhooked from my wrist
to fold out a thumb keypad. Like many things in the Civboot it looks like it
was made in the 80's but designed by someone obsessed with minimalism from the
present.

I get inside my bunk and remove my civilian clothing, stashing it at the
bottom of my personal effects. "Won't be needing these anymore" I say to
myself, putting the Civboot uniform on. I feel odd and decide to lay down,
trying to gauge my feelings. Sad... alone... maybe a little scared. "What the
fuck have I got myself into" I speak into the noise isolated bunk. I feel like I
am a prisoner. A prisoner in a prison with lots of hugs, nerds and vintage
tech. Deep, deep, deep underground. Is this really what I wanted? Is _this_
something that will help me to feel less empty inside?
