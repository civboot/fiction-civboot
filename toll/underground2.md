After a shower, Toll went to breakfast at exactly 6:30AM. He had played with his
new pwatch (com-puter watch, pronounced "puh-wa-tch") before bed, reading some
of the manuals and looking over his schedule. Like military submarines and other
places where people lived with no access to light, the schedule was extremely
orderly to ensure people maintained a consistent circidean rythm of sleep and
wakefullness.

"Morning" said a new voice to toll, sitting across from him at the table with
a plate of eggs, toast and fruit.

Toll shook the outstretched hand.  "Good morning, my name's Toll."

"Jamie" said Jamie, "mechanical engineer and resident sweetheart." Jamie was
a very handsom thirty five year old man, probably the youngest resident besides
Toll's thirty years.

Toll noticed the wedding ring on his hand and smiled. "Does your wife know
you're such a charmer?"

"Why do you think she married me?" Jamie said, a sparkle in his eyes as he
started to shovel eggs into his mouth.

Toll took a long sip of coffee. "How long have you been down here? Is there a
point things start to feel more normal?"

Jamie chewed on his eggs while he though, washing it down with coffee. "I don't
think being buried underground can ever feel good, but it can resemble
normalness after a while. It might even start to feel..." Jamie moved his hand
around, searching for the word. "Safe. Secure. I think when you're confined for
long enough your brain starts to convert that feeling into other emotions. Like
how if you go for enough runs you begin to enjoy even the pain you feel."

"Speaking of which" Jamie said, shoveling down his oatmeal and guzziling the
rest of his cofee "I've got to get off to the track before my shift starts. You
joining me?"

Toll had almost never jogged in his life, but he wasn't going to turn down an
offer of company. He also knew that he needed to build up the habbit to preserve
his mental health. He had been meaning to for months but had just... never
gotten around to it okay?

Jamie had eaten with phenominal speed, so Toll quickly shoveled the rest of his
own food into his mouth and took his coffee to-go, drinking it as they walked to
their bunk beds and changed into shorts. Jamie did stretches and then simply
started jogging down the hall.

"The entire facility was constructed as one long oval with rooms branching off at
angles of about twenty degrees" said Jamie, jogging breathlesslessly. Toll was
already starting to breath heavy to keep up. "It was dug by the same drill,
which can only execute turns at that angle. The drill branches off and then is
reversed back into the oval tunnel to continue drilling this main hall."

They passed Dr Jong with a woman Toll hadn't yet met. Toll waved as he jogged
by, his breath almost abandoning him. "I need to slow down" he heaved.

Jamie cut his pace in half without sign of judgement. "There is the tunel down
to the core", he said, pointing to their right. It had been the only tunel
pointing into the oval, and the only tunel sloped downwards. "It turns into a
stairway and then an elevator and goes deep into the earth. The drill is still
down there, along with a smaller drill for creating the geothermal pipes we use
for energy harvesting. The entire facility is powered by that system, with
backup batteries that can last up to maybe a week. It's one of the main
differences with the Martian system which uses solar, wind and nuclear power."

"Wind?" gasked Toll. Even at half pace his breath was still short. "I thought
Mars had no air?" he breathed. At this point, Mars probably had more air than
him.

"Mars has a hundred times less atmosphere than earth. But wind turbine power
generation is only linear to the air pressure, it is exponential to the wind
velocity. Mars has high wind velocity at the exact times that there is very
little sunlight: during dust storms. Therefore a mix of both wind and solar is
the best strategy to ensure consistent power. As well as nuclear for heavy
industry of course."

Toll nodded his head, that all made sense. "So why do we use geothermal?"

Jamie gave a laugh, "The expense of nuclear power plants is far too large,
they would need five people down here just to man the station. Also, geothermal
is much more reliable. We actually have two separate geothermal generators,
one large and a small backup. There are two goals with the underground Civboots:
to mimick Mars and to be a highly resilient bastion of technology. That's my
guess anyway, nobody ever talks about the second reason."

They came around the bend and Jamie's watch went off. He came to a walk, letting
Toll catch his breath before continuing. "I'm going to do a few more laps at my
normal pace. It was nice running with you. You should keep it up, I appreciate
having a running partner." Jamie gave Toll a hug and took off, back at double
pace. Toll had been disguistingly sweaty while Jamie was still dry.

After he had showered and changed he went over to Maye's station again. She was
already inspecting the same plant as before under her microscope. When she heard
him approach she turned and stood, embracing him.

"Thanks for coming. I'd really appreciate it if someone could take a look at
this damned autoharverster. The thing just doesn't want to pick the
raspberries, making us pick them all by hand."

"I'll take a look" said Toll, "but I want you to know I still have only a little
experience with Civboot's software stack and will need some time to learn. I've
been taught the basics but have never tried to actually fix a real problem."

Maye nodded her head "That's fine, I'm sure it's more than I could do. I've got
my work cut out for me trying to figure out this strand of fungus that somehow
made it in our home. I think it's a South American variety, meaning it must have
come from somebody's trip to South America and laid dormant for months if not
years. It's wreaking some havok on the vegetables and I'm still not sure what
the remedy is."
