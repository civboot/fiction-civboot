After a shower I arrived at breakfast at exactly 6:30AM. I had played with my
new pwatch (com-puter watch, pronounced "pew-ahtch") before bed last night,
reading some of the manuals and looking over my schedule. Like military
submarines and other places where people lived with no access to light, the
schedule was extremely orderly to ensure everyone maintained a consistent
circidean rythm of sleep and wakefullness.

"Morning" said a new voice, sitting across from me at the table with a plate of
eggs, toast and fruit.  I shook the outstretched hand. "Good morning, name's
Jamie. Mechanical engineer and resident sweetheart." Jamie was a very handsom
thirty five year old man, probably the youngest resident besides
my thirty years.

I noticed the wedding ring on his hand and smiled. "My name's Toll. Does your
wife know you're such a charmer?"

"Why do you think she married me?" Jamie asked, a sparkle in his eyes as he
started to shovel eggs into his mouth.

I took a long sip of coffee. "How long have you been down here? Does she miss
you?"

TODO: my wife's hand is on my shoulder. She's telling me I need to go to bed...

"Been here for about a year," Jamie said, still chewing on his eggs. He washed
them down with coffee. "I don't think being buried underground can ever feel
good, but it can resemble normalness after a while. It might even start to
feel..." Jamie moved his hand around, searching for the word. "Safe. Secure. I
think when you're confined for long enough your brain starts to convert that
feeling into other emotions. Like how if you go for enough runs you begin to
enjoy even the pain you feel."

"Speaking of which" Jamie said, shoveling down his oatmeal and guzziling the
rest of his cofee "I've got to get off to the track before my shift starts. You
joining me?"

I had almost never jogged in my life, but I wasn't going to turn down an offer
of company. I also need to build up the habbit to preserve my mental health. I
have been meaning to for months but just... never gotten around to it okay?

Jamie had eaten with phenominal speed, so I quickly shoveled the rest of my food
down and took my coffee to-go, drinking it as we walked to our beds and changed
into shorts. Jamie did stretches and then simply started jogging down the hall.

"The entire facility was constructed as one long oval with rooms branching off at
angles of about twenty degrees" said Jamie, jogging breathlesslessly. I was
already starting to breath heavy to keep up. "It was dug by the same drill,
which can only execute turns at that angle. The drill branches off and then is
reversed back into the oval tunnel to continue drilling this main hall."

We passed Dr Jong with a woman I hadn't yet met. I waved as we jogged
by. My breath was almost ready to abandon me. "I need to slow down" I heaved.

Jamie cut his pace in half without any other reaction. "There is the tunel down
to the core", he said, pointing to their right. It had been the only tunel
pointing into the oval, and the only tunel sloped downwards. "It turns into a
stairway and then an elevator and goes deep into the earth. The drill is still
down there, along with a smaller drill for creating the geothermal pipes we use
for energy harvesting. The entire facility is powered by that system, with
backup batteries that can last up to maybe a week. It's one of the main
differences with the Martian system which uses solar, wind and nuclear power."

"Wind?" I gasped. Even at half pace my breath was still short. "I thought Mars
had no air?" I breathed. At this point, Mar's atmopshere probably had me beat.

"Mars has a hundred times less atmosphere than earth. But wind turbine power
generation is only linear to the air pressure, it is exponential to the wind
velocity. Mars has high wind velocity at the exact times that there is very
little sunlight: during dust storms. Therefore a mix of both wind and solar is
the best strategy to ensure consistent power. As well as nuclear for heavy
industry of course."

I nodded my head, that all made sense. "So why do we use geothermal?"

Jamie gave a laugh, "The expense of nuclear power plants is far too large,
they would need five people down here just to man the station. Also, geothermal
is much more reliable. We actually have two separate geothermal generators,
one large and a small backup. There are two goals with the underground Civboots:
to mimick Mars and to be a highly resilient bastion of technology. That's my
guess anyway, nobody ever talks about the second reason."

We came around the bend and Jamie's watch went off. He came to a walk, letting
me catch my breath before continuing. "I'm going to do a few more laps at my
normal pace. It was nice running with you. You should keep it up, I appreciate
having a partner." Jamie gave me a hug and took off, back at double
pace. I was disguistingly sweaty while he was still dry.

After I had showered and changed I went over to Maye's station again. She was
already inspecting the same plant as before under her microscope. When she heard
me approach she turned and stood, embracing me.

"Thanks for coming. I'd really appreciate it if someone could take a look at
this damned autoharverster. The thing just doesn't want to pick the
raspberries, making us pick them all by hand."

"I'll take a look" I said, "but I want you to know I still have only a little
experience with Civboot's software stack and will need some time to learn. I've
been taught the basics but have never tried to fix a harvester."

Maye nodded her head "That's fine, I'm sure it's more than I could do. I've got
my work cut out for me trying to figure out this strand of fungus that somehow
made it in our home. I think it's a South American variety, meaning it must have
come from somebody's trip to South America and laid dormant for months if not
years. It's wreaking some havok on the vegetables and I'm still not sure what
the remedy is."
